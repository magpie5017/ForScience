# ForScience
For Science is an incremental/idle game built with primarily Knockout.js, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript. Game can be run locally by opening index.html in any browser. 

The mechanics of the game are simple - click the sesearch button to gain research. Spend research to publish papers, get money, etc. Buy more cabinets to store more research and collect ever-larger amounts of resources.

Future Additions:
* LocalStorage saving
* Purchasing resources in multiples
* Characters with individual research counts
* Unlockable events with resource boosts
